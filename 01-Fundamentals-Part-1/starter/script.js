//VALUES AND VARIABLES

let js = 'amazing';
console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);

console.log('Jonas');
console.log(23);

// declaring a variable
// type _ name = value of variable
let firstName = "Jonas"

// variables are a way to store data!
// variables use camelCase
// variable names should be descriptive! by reading the variable name, people should know what value the variable holds

//descriptive variable names
let myFirstJob = "Programmer";
let myCurrentJob = "Teacher";
//variable names that aren't too descriptive
let job1 = "Programmer";
let job2 = "Teacher";


//console.log = outputs our code to the console

console.log(firstName)

//PRACTICE

let country = "USA";
let continent = "North America";
let population = 328000000

console.log(country, continent, population)

//DATA TYPES

//values are either an object or primitive value.

//Primitive data types:
//  Number = used for decimals and integers
//  String = sequence of characters used for text, always in quotes
//  Boolean = logical type that can only be true or false, used to take decisions
//  Undefined = value taken by a varialbe that is not yet defined('empty value') ex: let children
//  Null = also means 'empty value' but is used in different circumstances
//  Symbol = defines a value that is unique and cannot be changed
//  BigInt = large integars than what Number can hold

//JS authomatically determines the value of a data type when it's stored in a variable (called dynamic typing)

//Can find the type of value by console.logging with typeof


let javascriptIsFun = true;
console.log(javascriptIsFun);

console.log(typeof true);
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun);
console.log(typeof 23);
console.log(typeof 'Jonas')
